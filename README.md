# botdoc

A cog for discord.py that automatically generates markdown documentation for your bot's cogs and commands.

## Install

Clone the repo into your cogs folder

```
git clone https://github.com/zedchance/botdoc.git
```

Add `cogs.botdoc.botdoc` to your cogs array:
```py
cogs = [ ..., 'cogs.embed_help.help']
```

### Once its setup

Each time your bot is loaded and the cogs are loaded, the documentation is automatically generated in a directory called `docs`.

## How it works

botdoc works best if you know how to take advantage of it. Commenting and describing your commands will help generate
better documentation. 

A typical bot command may look something like this:

```py
@commands.command(name='ping',
                  description='Pings back message to the user',
                  aliases=['pong', 'p'],
                  case_insensitive=True)
async def ping_command(self, ctx, *message):
    """ Responds with the word 'Ping' followed by the message """
    msg = ' '.join(message)
    return await ctx.send(f'Ping! {msg}')
```

The documentation is automatically generated by using doc string comments and other properties of cogs. The description
is the `description` parameter in the generator. Syntax is shown using both the `aliases` list and the parameter names
in the header of the function (in this case its `message`). Since `message` has the asterisk `*` in front it means that
it can be multiple words long. 

Lets say this command lived in a cog named `Basic` and that the prefix of the bot is `!`,
botdoc will generate a file called `docs/basic.md` in the same directory as the bot's main.py file that will look like
this:

## Basic

 * [`ping`](#ping)

### **`ping`**

Pings back message to the user

Responds with the word 'Ping' followed by the message

#### Syntax

`![ping|pong|p] <*message>`
